  "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\n[Verse]\nThe sun creeps in across the floor\nI hear the traffic outside the door\nThe coffee pot begins to hiss\nIt is another morning just like this\n\n[Prechorus]\nThe world keeps spinning round and round\nFeet are planted on the ground\nI find my rhythm in the sound\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery day the light returns\nEvery day the fire burns\nWe keep on walking down this street\nMoving to the same steady beat\nIt is the ordinary magic that we meet\n\n[Verse]\nThe hours tick deeply into noon\nChasing shadows,chasing the moon\nWork is done and the lights go low\nWatching the city start to glow\n\n[Bridge]\nIt is not always easy,not always bright\nSometimes we wrestle with the night\nBut we make it to the morning light\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery day the light returns\nEvery day the fire burns\nWe keep on walking down this street\nMoving to the same steady beat\n\n[Outro]\nJust another day\nEvery single day",
